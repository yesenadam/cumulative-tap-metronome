# Cumulative Tap Metronome

### Bash script to find the tempo of your key taps

Finds the tempo of a piece of music. I tried a couple of android apps, but the tempo number kept jumping aroundâ€”it was hard to get a precise figure except by guessing. This script uses the total time, not just the time in between each tap. Keep tapping the tempo, and after a dozen or so taps the number stops changing and you can read off a fairly precise figure, to one decimal place.

Also it can be used to find your typing speed in keystrokes per minute! Just run it and type into it as fast as you can for a little while.

### Setup
Put `tap` in a folder in your bash PATH and `chmod +x tap`. Then in bash type `tap`, tap in tempo until the tempo number settles down to a stable value. Ctrl-C to quit.

### Requirements

macOS and some other systems will need to install `gdate` from GNU coreutils, as their `date` can't show milliseconds. Linux and some other systems can use their existing `date`.
